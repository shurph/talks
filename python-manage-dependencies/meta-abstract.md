# How to manage dependencies in your Python project in a production-ready manner

In this talk I'll show how you might manage dependencies more painless and in a modern manner. In most tutorials you can see that you just need to use pip and requirements.txt and this is fine. It's true… as long as you're doing it on your local machine, without production server, without teammates. If you're developing some production-ready project in a collaboration with a team you need some another approach.

I will show how you can move your local «pet» project from pip+requirements.txt to Pipenv, a brand-new system for a package managing in the Python world. In addition, I'll highlight why all this is necessary.

A BONUS PART: we will learn how you can manage dependencies in projects using conda, the special tool for the special Python platform — Anaconda which is mainly popular in a Data Science and Machine Learning field.
